# MGSC 670: Retail Game

### Richard Gao, Sophie-Courtemanche Martel, Bogdan Tanasie, Duncan Wang, & Tiancheng Zhang 

In the fashion and apparel retail industry, inventory moves fast. Each season, fashion retailers must decide which products to design, produce, and sell, while making strategic pricing and quantity-based decisions in order to most optimally capture the market. Markdown, or the practice of discounting products based on a perceived inability to sell at the original price point, is one of the most common and key pricing decisions used by fashion retailers today. 

The objective of this analysis is to develop a markdown pricing strategy for a hypothetical retailer over a simulated 15 week sales period that could be applied to any sales season. By using historical demand observed across a variety of products, we will develop a method for identifying when to mark down products, for how long, and at which level, in order to maximize revenues for the retailer while meeting a series of context-specific constraints.
